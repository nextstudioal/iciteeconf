		</br>Evis Trandafili and Stela Paturri</summary>
		<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		This paper contributes to the implementation of a Handwritten Text Recognition system for Albanian
language, employing an attention-based encoder-decoder architecture. To address the absence of a
publicly available Albanian handwritten dataset, we used the following approach: generate a
synthetic dataset using deep learning methods, streamline dataset creation and finally enabling
training for Albanian Handwritten Text Recognition model. Considering the train data scarcity in
Albanian, we employed pre-trained models for English handwriting recognition. The experiments
show promising results, which in the future may serve as a performance benchmark for Handwritten
Text Recognition systems while handling new and untested languages.

	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Extracting features and using them as attributes for sentiment analysis is a known practice for
improving the accuracy of the machine learning models. Albanian language is a morphological rich
language which poses several challenges on classification tasks and feature engineering. In this paper
we investigate the features based on word frequency. We identify two available Albanian datasets
for sentiment analysis and extract most 2000 frequent words. We apply three different approaches
on extracting the features: bag of words, bag of words without stop words and bag of words with
negation handling. We test four classification models for each dataset and achieve an accuracy of .949
for the Naïve Bayes.

	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Nowadays, big data is available in many areas of science, so the need to summarize data sets into
groups and extract information is important. Using the cluster analysis technique, we can explore
such data based on their similarity. The degree of similarity in the data is quantitatively represented
by the distance functions. In this paper, using Ward's method of cosine distance in a database with
100 Albanian texts, we achieved a model with a Dunn’s index value of 0.7209. This model separated
the Albanian texts into 16 different clusters based on the frequency of words, with 87 percent of texts
well classified by author.

	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Using the smartphone while walking is a diffused behaviour among young adults and represents a danger
near crossing roads or walking down the streets because it impairs their situational awareness. In this
paper, we propose a privacy-preserving and continuous monitoring of people’s behaviours with the help
of a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. Thanks to machine learning we are able to
distinguish between the so called “smartphone zombies" gait and the normal gait with a median accuracy
of 92.4%; when adding a third class of fast walkers the median accuracy becomes 87.6%.

to achieve fiber service for a certain number of addresses, but the challenge lies in trying to realize
this design in the best possible way, as economically as possible and adhering to world design
standards. Respective data are prepared and entered in QGIS and after making sure that the data is
accurate as in the field, it is entered into COMSOF software, which processes, calculates and optimizes
all the data entered, making sure the output is well-organized and has the best optimization and low

	  </br>Yusuf Kaçar, Halil İbrahim Cebeci and Emrah Aydemir</summary>
	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Artificial intelligence often permeates all aspects of life without recognizing any boundaries or rules
and transforms society. Soft law texts addressing potential legal and ethical issues that may arise in
this context have only recently begun to emerge. In the study, biblioshiny, the web interface of the
bibliometrix library in the R program, was utilized for the analysis. Given that the study revolves
around artificial intelligence, ethics, and law, the search terms were selected as "Artificial intelligence
or machine learning" and "ethic" and "law or legal or regulation or juristic," with only English records
considered. No time restrictions were imposed. A total of 2132 academic works were examined, and
besides the strong relationship between the concept of ethics and privacy, the concepts of
transparency, cybersecurity, governance, data protection, responsibility, and accountability also
stood out. The number of publications has notably increased, particularly in the last 5-6 years, and it
is evident that the field has garnered significant attention across various regions of the world. These
studies are predominantly found in computer science-oriented journals. While the studies initially
leaned towards technology-focused topics, in recent times, they have shifted towards ethical
considerations centered on human and psychology.

	  </br>Okan Karakaya and Emrah Aydemir</summary>
	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		YouTube, a platform with billions of daily video views, where users leave comments for their opinions
on videos. The analysis of these comments is actively utilized in various fields, ranging from customer
feedback improvement opportunities, competitive analysis, brand reputation, product development,
marketing, and sales to risk management. Comment analysis involves processing and making sense
of big data, aiding in strategic decision-making. Additionally, methods such as sentiment analysis can
reveal users' emotions and emotional reactions derived from the comments. Comments from 10
automobile introduction videos on the YouTube platform were collected, resulting in a total of 9,700
comments. Initially, these comments were examined based on view and like counts, followed by
sentiment analysis categorizing them as positive or negative. While the comments were very high in
the first months, the number of comments decreased in the following months due to the aging of the
video topic. Additionally, when the comments are examined in terms of sentiment analysis, it is
noteworthy that the numbers of both positive and negative comments are close to each other.
However, it is seen that a small number of video comments contain more than 60% emotion. It seems
that some videos have a high number of comments because they are more remarkable in terms of
content or have a large number of members.

	  </br>Djazila Korti and Zohra Slimane</summary>
	 <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		In this study, we undertake a comparative analysis of model performance for Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) when managing multi-source radar data. To this end, we carry out three
experiments using a multiple-input model, concatenating data samples and fusing data samples.
These experiments are conducted using three datasets containing micro-Doppler signatures of
human activities. The results show that the use of a multi-input model represents the most efficient
approach, achieving the highest level of accuracy at 94.65%.

	  </br>Fatmir Basholli and Bexhet Kamo</summary>
	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Loads/equipment especially in industrial applications and other different applications that use
electric motors, draw current from the network while rotating, but in case of a sudden force
(braking effect) they start to produce electricity themselves. This energy is sent back to the source
they are fed and in such a case the regenerative energy should be managed. If this type of load is
fed by a UPS (uninterruptible power supply), in the braking mode, the UPS applies the extra energy
to its DC BUS through the reverse diodes of the output power transistors (IGBT), which causes the
DC BUS voltage to rise. This extra energy, regenerative energy, may be used by other equipment in
the network when is possible and if not (technically), to prevent the DC BUS rise, a resistor group
driven/ controlled by the respective controller is placed on the DC BUS to “re-route” the energy
usage and prevent the UPS damage.
In this paper we provide an algorithm that may be used to control this process of using
regenerative energy by network or by re-routing it in the group of resistors.

	  </br>Adrian Besimi, Nuhi Besimi and Xhemal Zenuni</summary>
	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more crucial with applications on various domains.
It also impacts education and research, making it a valuable tool to find better ways to review
literature. This abstract outlines why AI matters and how we use OpenAI's API for better literature
reviews and finding relevant research articles for specific topic. Our proposed methodology involves
three steps: 1) First, we collect research articles from the IEEE API on a specific topic; 2) next, we
cluster these articles based on similar keywords and sort them by number of citations, and 3) then,
we use OpenAI to analyze the extracted articles and write short summaries for the top five groups of
articles. The result is a Word document with all the summaries. AI's value lies in saving time and
making the research process more manageable. With so many research articles available, AI helps
collect and summarize them faster, so researchers can focus on analyzing and interpreting the data.
The most crucial part is using OpenAI's API. It helps us create short, easy-to-understand summaries
of the articles in the top five groups. These summaries make the complex research information simple
to understand. In summary, AI and OpenAI can help us making the literature review process simpler
and easier by saving time and making research information more accessible. AI's role in research is
growing, and this method aligns with that trend, making it easier to share and understand research
findings.

	  </br>Elior Vila</summary>
	  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>
		Quantum computing is rapidly growing due to the high expectations of new emerging computer
systems which can carry out computational tasks much faster than today’s traditional binary
machines. The next generation of computers will be capable of solving specific problems with great
improvements in efficiency compared to classical computers. These capabilities may have great
positive impacts on many complex applications that today rely on conventional computer systems.
Apart from benefits, quantum computing may pose significant danger to the security of some
cryptographic algorithms, thus putting them at risk of compromising their secure operation.
Therefore, the development of such systems needs to be faced with challenges of design of postquantum
cryptographic algorithms which must be resistant to the massive computation power of
upcoming quantum computers. This paper investigates the current situation of cryptographic
algorithms and analyses the possible impact of advancing quantum systems on modern
cryptography. Finally, some directions in post-quantum cryptography devoted to protecting
traditional computer systems are discussed.
