	<strong>Abstract. </strong>The implementation of Continuous Software Engineering (CSE)
	practices is a must for software development companies to succeed in a highly 
	competitive market. Software products are continuously released in small and
	incremental cycles, which turns to have its associated risks of failure. This 
	systematic literature review investigates and classifies the challenges present in 
	each stage of the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
	pipeline and the available strategies and tools used to address and solve these 
	challenges. We analyzed forty-six relevant papers, filtered from four digital 
	libraries, and provided information published in the last five years on behalf of 
	CSE practices. Our study emphasizes that the selection of the right CSE 
	strategy and automation tool to use is based on the project.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong>It is a trend nowadays for software projects to be developed by teams distributed  geographically  in  different  locations.  Despite  the  benefits  provided by  this  globalization,  projectmanagement  methods  or  softwaredevelopment processes must be adapted. Inthis paper we analyze the publications conducted in  recent  years  to  identify  the  challenges, trends,and  the  less  explored  area  of Agile  Methodologies  for  distributed  software  development  (DSD).  We  have conducted aSystematic  Literature  Review  (SLR)  for  the  publications  through the  years  2017-2021  where  we  could  give  an  answer  to  the  questions:  What evidence  is  provided  for  DSD?  Which  are  the  factors  that  impact  agile development  in  distributed  software  development?and  are  there  new  models proposed  or  novel  approaches  for  Agile  in  DSD?Results:  We  identified  an increased  interest  in  Agile  for  Distributed  Software  Development  where  in focus for the literature where the case studies and their feedback with guidelinesand    proposal   of   hybrid   models   implementation.   Scrum   and   Extreme Programming  are  being  the  most  reviewed  methods  with  an  interest  in  Peer Programming  and  Lean  Programming.  At  the  same  time,  a  lot  of  attention  is given  to  scaled  agile and  its adoption  for  distributed  teams  too, where  most  of the  analysis  is  focused  on  Scrum  of  Scrums,  Scaled  Agile  Framework  and Disciplined Agile Delivery.</details>

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> 
	Every  part  of  our  lives  is  being  affected  by  information  technology. Of  course,  different  areas  of  life  develop  at  different  speeds  when  interacting with the digital world. One of the areas where digitalization is moving at a very slow  pace,  compared  to  other  areas,  is  that  of  spare  parts  for  automotive, especially  those  used.  It  is  a  whole  profitable  industry  which  loses  significant amounts of income by not having accurate data on the products and services it deals  with,  supply  chains,  current  innovations  and  updates,  the  flow  of  work processes,  etc. This  situation  brings many  difficulties  for  all actors  involved  in this  industry,  especially  customers.  Lekotech,  is  an  information  ecosystem, which  in  the  essence  of  its  existence,  has  the  digitalization  of  this  industry  by completely  revolutionizing  the  work  processes,  sales -customer  interactions, the  way  of  identifying  the  products  that  are  sold,  their  tracking,  determining their compatibility, etc.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Human activity classification is assuming a great relevance in many fields,including the well-being of the elderly. Many methodologies to improve the predictionof human activities, such as falls or unexpected behaviors, have been proposed over theyears, exploiting different technologies. In this paper, we consider a dataset containingdifferent types of activities related to human walking. We started by processing rawdata obtained from an automotive radar and then we perform feature extraction fromrange-Doppler maps. To obtain reliable results we compare different deep learningarchitectures and different optimizers. We show through results that an accuracy ofmore then 97% is achieved with an appropriate selection of the network parameters.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> A friendly environment and good quality of air are key factors for a healthy  life.  Air  pollution  has  become  a  serious  problem  in  Albania  as  well. Technology   is   the   right   tool, that   can   help   to   monitor   and   analyze environmental   air   quality   parameters.   One   of   today's   challenges   with technology is process automation and improvement by monitoring, controlling,and  analyzing  data  through  artificial  intelligence.  To  facilitate,  improve and secure  work  processes  and  community  living,  more  and  more  studies  and projects  are  being  implemented  in  the  field  of  IoT,  intelligent  and  automated systems. In this paper, we propose an IoT project for “smart environments” that monitors,   generates   alarms   and   makespredictions   for   air   quality   of   the surrounding environment. Its purpose is to provide the necessary information to the  user  about  the  quality  of  environmental  parameters,  to  store  data  for analysis  using  Cloud  platforms, and to  generate  alarms.  We  also  implement  aMachine  Learning algorithm  to  make  predictionsfor  the  obtained  parameters. Experimental  evaluation  shows  the  efficacy  of  the  system  in  monitoring, storing, data analyzing and prediction.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> The interest that Knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) models have re-ceived, has significantly increased over the last years. Training KGE models is a te-dious process that requires high CPU and memory capacity. Different industries aretraining their huge, often distributed datasets using KGE models. An urge to scaleKGE models has evolved, to ensure that the researcher’s hard work is being alignedwith the needs of the industry of big data. To tackle the issue of resource availabilityor usage limitations, we have come up with an approach for distributing both trainingand testing of Translating embeddings (TransE) model [1], using a cluster with sharedmemory layer.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Nowadays,  whenever  we  want  to  listen  to  music on  our  mobile phone, on the radio,pc, or any other portable device, we are most likely to refer to a playlist –a collection of several tracks -to be played in a certain sequence. Existing music players display playlists that are elaborated based on the users’ taste,  but  they  do  not  feature  relationships  between  tracks.  Some  of  the  latter introduced  tools  generate  automated  playlists  relying  on  tracks’  metadata information, creating a predictive and narrow playlist, which can be repetitive if the  same  input is used.  In  this paper  we analyze some  of  the  existing  tools for playlist  generation  and  present  WowTune,  a  multi-layer  Automated  Playlist Generator  tool  based  on  web  services. We then drill  down to the  details of the logic this tool relies on and compare the selected tracks with the ones generated by  the  existing  tools.  The resultsof  our  research  showthat  the  backend  logic used by WowTune tool to generate an unpredicted playlist, succeeds in creating a pleasant playlist for the users and close to their music preferences.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> In this paperis studied the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) performance ofa delta-sigmaAnalog   to   Digital   converter(ADC). Analog   to   digital converters  are crucialcomponents  in almostany electronic  systemsand  the choice of an ADC architecture is driven by the application.The ADCs used in these systems maybe affected by differentnoise sources.Through simulations we evaluate the impact of filter length, oversampling ratio, transition bandwidth and  decimation  factor  in  SNR  values  of  the  ADC.Optimal  values  of  these parameters  are  suggested  in  order to  reduce  the  noise  effect  and  consequently improve SNR.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Mobile  applications  that  use  data,  video,  and  voice,  depend  on  the performance  of  the  network.  Nowadays  the  demand  for  higher  capacity  and quantity  of  data,  has  led  to  significant  development  of  mobile  networking systems.  This  paper  deals  with  the  construction  of  an  UMTS  network  and  the use  of  this  network  as  efficiently  as  possible.  The  goal  is  a  full  coverage network with high capacity in the Tirana area. The work is based on prediction and  calculation  of  the  signal  coverage.  In  the  conducted  experiments,the location  and  the  type  of  antenna  will  be  used  for  the  establishment  of  the network.  In  addition,  we  have  used  a  tool  for  predicting  signal  coverage.  We have tried to reach full coverage by using the lowest number of antennas. In our experiments,  we  verified  that  the  tool  is  not  accurate  for  urban  areas  with greater   density   and   that   there   is   relevant   difference   between   theoretical modeling  and  experiments  in  practice.  We  provide  experimental  evidence  for our conclusions and we provide a critical discussion on planning processes.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Nowadays, cyber security plays a crucial role for any organization. National and international data protection regulations require particular attention to cyberrisk assessment and cyber risk management. Many efforts have been devoted to the de-velopment of efficient tools and methods for cyber risk assessment. However, existingmethodologies often lack straightforwardness, and their implementation is difficult inreal case scenarios. The aim of this paper is to provide an intuitive but quantitativemodel to estimate the likelihood of occurrence of a cyber threat in a certain periodof time. Then, a cyber risk index can be obtained by multiplying such a quantity bythe impact of the corresponding threat. Our model combines maturity and complexityindexes with the attractiveness of the considered organization by exploiting a gen-eralized logistic function and the properties of conditional probabilities. Numerical examples are provided to confirm practicality of the method.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Pursuant  to  the  legislation  in  force  for  cyber  security,  NAECCS  in Albania  aims  increasing  the  level  of  security  in  networks  and  information systems  in  the  Republic  of  Albania.  Actually,  there  are  identified  90  CII  and there is a continuous process for increasing those numbers. The results from the survey  conducted  by  NAECCS,  have  shown  a  significant  gap  between  central and local  government  related  to  cybersecurity,  in  providing  the  necessary infrastructure, and guarantee a certain level of cyber readiness. Based  on  the  European  directive  NIS,  which  categorizes  both  the  critical infrastructure  and  the  local  government,  whichmanages  the  water,  tax  and other  important  infrastructures  that  directly  impact  the  citizen,  it  is  carried  out an  assessment  of  cyber  readiness  on  local  government.  This  article  considers the   situation   of   three   municipalities   of   different   size   and   will   give recommendation on the processes to be implemented in order to reach e certain level of cybersecurity.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Trusted  Computing  is  an  innovative  technology  that  aims  to  offer security  solutions  by  combining software  and  hardware protection  capabilities. Today,   most   computing   and   communication   systems,   utilize   software approaches that are supposed to be installed and configured correctly. However, such software may be affected by other software present on the same platform or  by  malicious  software  that  has  compromised  the  operating  system.  Trusted Computing  makes  use  of  extra  cheap  hardware  added  to  the  platform  which provides    flexible    security    mechanisms.    The    implementation    of    such mechanisms  may  present  some  challenges  to  be  faced  with.  The  main  goal  of this paper is to investigate such challenges and at the same time to explore the opportunities  of  Trusted  Computing  towards  the  security  enhancement  in specific areas. The focus of our work will be the Trusted Platform Module that provides the key cryptographic and protection functionalities.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> In this paper, some effective training methods are reported to explain lin-ear control systems to a class of undergraduate students during the Summer SchoolSysE 2021 in Imperia. The learning methods are composed of two parts with sometheoretical and practical lessons. The focus of the proposing approach is to use thetheoretical notions in a real case study. In this example, students test linear controlsystem theory in a homemade toy car previously assembled. Three different experi-ments using the PID controller are performed: following a specific track drawn on awhite paper, stopping as close as possible to an obstacle, using of wheels encoder totravel an exact distance. During these tests, the PID controller has been designed andtuned to automate the minicar’s displacement.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Nowadays, computer programs have played an essential role in the management  of  libraries  or  bookstores.Through  them  we  can  quickly  load books into the system,also with high efficiency, short operating time, low cost, and  other  advantages.  However,  there  are  large  library  management  systems used   to   manage   small   or   medium-sized   libraries,   leading   to   a   waste   of resources. Thus, software developers propose to solve the problem of managing not too large libraries by using Java as the programming language.Inthis paper we will introduce the development of a computerized management system that responds to the requirements of small libraries.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> The  study  of  transmission  lines  forms  an  integral  part  of  any curriculum  in  electrical  engineering.  Studying  and  teaching  the  students  the subject  of  electromagnetic  fields  for  many  years,  I  have  noticed  that  some interesting  facts  about  transmission  linesare  not  available  in  textbooks.  We have encountered during the details study in the teaching cycle with students. In this  paper,  I`ve  treated  a  special problem,  regarding  the  value  of  the  reflection coefficient.  Despite  the  fact  that  theoretically,  this  value  is  less  than  the  unit, this paper treats the conditions and the model of a real transmission line with a reflection  coefficient  greater  than  the  unit.  The  applied  methodology  and conclusion  presented  are  fully  in  meeting  to  the  power  balance,  the  mainprinciple of circuit analysis, and transmission line theory.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Curricula  assessment  and  update  are  essential  pillars  of  academic activity,   especially   inthe   rapidly   changing   field   of   Information   and Communication   Technologies   (ICT).   To   be   competitive   and  improve   the employability  chances  of  our  students,  we  should  continuously  ensure  the match  between  the  curricula  and  the  labor  market  demand.  In  this  paper,  we present  two  labor  market  surveys  we  have  conducted  in  order  to  obtain  a broader perspective  on  this  issue  from  students’  and  companies’  side.  First survey  was  sent  to  Faculty  of  Information  Technology  alumni  and  the  second one  was  sent  to  companies /  institutions  of  ICT  field  in  Albania  hiring  these alumni. We  collected  a  total  of  145alumni  and 45companyrespondents. We illustrate  the  results of our  surveys  and, based  on  the  conclusions  we  get  from these   results,   we recommendfurther   steps   to   undertake   for   curricula improvements at our Faculty.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> Malware  is  a  constant  threat  for  all  users/computers  and  moreover the pandemic situation has shown an increase of such threats all over the world. It   is   not   enough   the   usage   of   security   programs:   antiviruses,   awareness campaign  on  how  to  navigate  safe  in  internet,  implementation  of  systems  for activity   monitoring.   Considering   in   a   wider   range,   monitoring   network communication  is  still  one  of  the  primary  methods  that  is  used  to  combat  and prevent  threats.  This  article  will  describe  how  regular,  periodic  ISP network monitoring  and  reporting,  contribute  in  reduction  of  malwares  and  prevention of  cyber  attacks,  mostly  at  critical  and  important  information  infrastructures. Lastly,  it  is  emphasized  the  need  for  real-time  communicationin  order  to shorten  the  time of  response  and  more  effective  mechanism  to  improve  the security of end users. In the context of cleanup from threats, the role of Internet Service  Providers  has  become  more  salient  over  time,  but  need  to  cooperate with relevant regulatory institutions.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> The increasing proliferation and availability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices  and  applications  have  created  a  growing  demand  for  5G  networks  in developing  countries.  Although developed  countries already have several  legal frameworks  that  they  are  working  on  to  prepare  for  the  challenges  brought forward by implementing 5G networks, developing countries are way behind in designing a robust legal framework backed by ethical standards and guidelines. One of the primary issues is that of privacy. Privacy issues raise several ethical concerns,   including   the   ownership   of   the   data,   the   responsibility   of   the manufacturer, and regulations on data collection. This study explores the ethical issues  concerns  involving  the  implementation  of  5G  networks.  This  study develops  an  ethical  framework  that  could  be  applied  in  developing  countries seeking to implement 5G networks. This study explores the current best practices adopted  by developed  countries  and  identifiesaspects  replicated  in  developing countries.  5G  networks  offer  several  prospects  for  startups  seeking  to  take advantage of the increasing use of IoT devices across developed and developing countries.   This   study   introduces   various   security   and   privacy   concerns surrounding the deployment of 5G networks.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> In this paper, an energy-aware version of Congestion Avoidance ShortestPath Routing protocol (CASPaR) is implemented and evaluated through simulations.The proposed protocol uses the threshold algorithm to determine, depending on theremaining node energy, whether a node should decide accepting or forwarding a mes-sage to its own neighbors. Different simulations are carried out with the OpportunisticNetwork Environment (ONE) simulator. Evaluation results show that the proposed andimplemented EA-CASPaR protocol reduces the number of dead nodes in the networkand the remaining energy of nodes is improved.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> The purpose of this paper is to create a system that identifies Albanian language in speech recordings as a preliminary step necessary for "speech to text" transcription. The problem is simplified in classifying the Albanian language into a set of audio signals of 2 languages: Albanian and English. The proposed system is  based  on  generating  audio  signals  spectrograms  and  using  them  as  input  to Neural  Networks  to  make  language  identification.  Artificial  Neural  Networksand Convolutional Neural Networks are used, and a comparison is made between them, to find out which model is better. The achieved accuracies are 85% (ANN) and  96%  (CNN),  respectively.  Both,  artificial  neural  network  as  well  as convolutional  neural  networks  are  capable  to  learn  spoken  Albanian  language patterns from their spectrogram representations.

	<strong>Abstract. </strong> The ability of a computer system to recognize objects quickly and effi-ciently is an important task. This paper presents the development of a machine learn-ing framework used to perform the tasks of image recognition and classification rely-ing on the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network. Multiple layers of thenetwork are cast upon datasets of image data with the purpose of implicitly extractingfeatures and understanding patterns that are used for classification. The neural networkis trained on large sets of image data with the objective of learning how to correctlyclassify previously unseen images. A series of experiments is performed to validatethe effectiveness of the proposed approach, on two separate datasets comprising thou-sands of images of fruits and traffic signs. Experimental results show that the proposedclassification framework distinguishes objects of such disparate categories with highaccuracy.
